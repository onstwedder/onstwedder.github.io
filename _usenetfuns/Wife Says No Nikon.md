A marriage made in heaven:  
  
M: Wow, I really think I've decided on a new lens  
W: No, Matt, we've discussed this and agreed, no more lenses for a while.  
M: But Honey! I'll do all the painting, I promise, starting with the living room.  
W: NO new lens  
M: And tear out the bathroom and re-build, I promise, before your parents visit in May.  
W: NO new lens  
M: And I'll attend those Wed. evening art apreciation classes with you,I promise  
W: NO, NO, NO, Read my lips: "NO new lens !!!"  
M: But, Honey, I'll buy a used one from e-bay, and save a bundle!!  
W: Well, how much will you save?  
M: Oh, you know, HUNDREDS!.  
W: Well, if you do all those things and save hundreds, then okay honey, I know you work hard and photography is your hobby...  
  
2 hours later...  

M: Yippee, I won a lens on e-bay.  
W: Great Honey, how much did you pay?  
M: And we'll go to Hawaii next winter, I promise.  
W: HOW MUCH?  
M: And you know, we can get enough money for your old klunker to buy a new mini-van for you, if we trade in those low yield bonds.  
W: __tapping foot, crossed arms__  HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR THE LENS!  
M: Well, honey, you have to understand it's one of the finest lenses there is, all my really good friends on r.p.e.35mm (even that jerk Alan)said to get one.  
W: How MUCH DID YOU PAY????!!!!  
M: Oh, listen the baby's crying.... I'll go see what's up!   __runs__

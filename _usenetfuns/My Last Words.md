I'd like mine to read...

'OK, so he's not actually dead yet... but it's been 300 years and we're
tired of waiting'


BTW. my 'famous last words' may probably be...

'What's that beeping noise?'

or...
'Hmmm... tastes of almonds, yummy'

or...
'Anyone else smell that?'

or...
'Is that bone supposed to do that...?'

or...
'Yeah? You and who's army...?'

or...
'Trust Me, it's the blue wi.....'

or...
'Aww what cute little fish...'

or...
'Yes that does make your bum look big, actually...'

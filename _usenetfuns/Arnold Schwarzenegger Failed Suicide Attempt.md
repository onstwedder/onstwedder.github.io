 [Submitter's note: the OP mentioned some fake message about Arnold Schwarzenegger having committed suicide.  Mr. Rickard then thought of a much more fitting way for Arnie ;-]

Rumour has it that it was a failed attempt. He armed 100 guys with AK47s and ran across an open field without any form of protection or cover. The plan seemed foolproof and his fate inevitable. However, despite his not insignificant size, not one bullet of the thousands of rounds found their target.

Arnie has since reconsidered and has a new idea for a film...

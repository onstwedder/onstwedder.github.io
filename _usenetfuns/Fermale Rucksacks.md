Different size / shape of back usually.   
   
Bigger Hip padding, on the off chance the wearer doesn't provide it herself. And an underwired chest strap.  Most of them also have a vanity pouch and break if they weigh more than 10% of any rucksack carried by any males in the group.   
   
They also have a maximum speed of about 1mph   
   
And no i don't resent that camping holiday i took with my gf last year.

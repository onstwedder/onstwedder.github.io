Even the Police in Liverpool are funny... We were up there on a Derby day   
(Everton v Liverpool) and in the Vines (a big atmospheric pub) and just   
about to get served at the bar when an almighty fight broke out in the other   
bar. There were literally cast iron tables flying through the air...   
   
They shut the pub and people were streaming out with blood on their faces   
and at least 6 police cars outside. complete mayhem. As I got to the exit I
asked one of the policemen, "Do you know of any other nice pubs around
here?"

Quick as a flash he replied, "What's wrong with this one?"

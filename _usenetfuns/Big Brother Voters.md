As an impartial observer of this argument, allow me to help.

Just to clarify:: the premise put forward by members of this group
is not that voting CAUSES stupidity, but that BEING stupid
already, may well cause you to vote.

In answer to your question:: If Stephen Hawking phoned in a vote,
then, according to the above premise, this would not suddenly make
him less intelligent (though some might argue that our initial perception
of his apparent intelligence was overrated).  Most likely however,
people would indeed then have to re-examine the premise that
everyone who votes is stupid.

Of course, the manner in which they revise the initial assertion
may still not be to your liking.  For example, they might suggest
that people who vote are either:

1. Stupid;
2. Misguided; or
3. Dialled the wrong number

But it's all academic.  He wouldn't vote, so they don't have to.

Hope this helps,
Fleeced

What?  You mean all those shows where they have an image that looks like it was shot on the equivalent of a 0.25 megapixel camera and   
ten seconds of snazzy computing later they've extracted details at a resolution of about 0.5mm from about 300m away aren't realistic?   
   
I am just shocked.   
   
I'm waiting for a scene in any show where the Heroes are standing behind the computer tech looking at a screen.   
   
&quot;It's a blobby shape in the driver's seat.&quot;   
   
&quot;Can you blow it up?&quot;   
   
(Tech looks at speaker funny and shrugs.)   
   
&quot;O-kay.  There you go. Now it's a big blobby shape in the driver's seat.&quot;

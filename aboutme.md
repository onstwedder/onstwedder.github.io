Hi,

I'm Martijn Onstwedder, and I have been an IT Professional for about 26 years. This website, onstwedder.com, has been online since July 16, 2000.

Around 1998, I started working for a small company in Rotterdam specialized in Delphi projects. After completing several projects for different customers, I did a project for a large insurance company. I enjoyed it so much that I applied there and have been working there ever since.

Initially, I continued working with Delphi by creating premium calculators as DLLs. However, the large company introduced me to many new technical challenges, including Lotus Notes, HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, JAVA, XML, and SOAP.

In 2017, my day job shifted its focus to the cloud. I first worked with AWS and became an AWS Certified Solution Architect, but soon transitioned to Azure. I became a skilled cloud engineer with knowledge of CICD pipelines, YAML, Terraform, networking, .NET, C#, and security.

At the end of 2022, I was asked to join a tech-savvy department tasked with introducing Kubernetes (K8S) for the business line I worked for, ensuring that application engineers could easily deploy their applications. Through ArgoCD, we successfully introduced K8S and GitOps. By the end of 2024, our team's goals were achieved, and we were moved from the business unit to the central IT Organization. Now, I work with AWS again, along with CDK and a hint of AI.

In my spare time, I spend a lot of time behind my computer, mostly gaming (deck builder games, survival games) and exploring new tech stuff. Whether it’s the new RTX 5090 or SpinKube to run Wasm in K8S, I’m always curious. Besides that, I also love watching stand-up comedy and British TV panel shows like "8 Out of 10 Cats Does Countdown" and "Taskmaster."

And if my first name "Martijn" wasn’t already a giveaway, I’m Dutch.
